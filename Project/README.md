As you probably noticed we haven't use yet our API key. I wanted to leave this bit four our final project.

## What do you need to do?
Use your imagination! :stuck_out_tongue:

Ok, now seriously:
+ Split into pairs and create a new ```Repo```.
+ Implement all the features you want from the last tutorials.
+ Please note that now you need to use your ```API key```.
+ Before doing any code, you must create a ```repo``` and raise some ```issues``` on ```GitHub```.


Here I listed a few examples of what you can do to inspire you:

I do really recommend to have a general look to the [Google Maps Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/), you will find lots of examples and demos.

Also...
+ [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
+ [Heatmaps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorials/earthquakes#heatmaps)

You can develop an amazing applications like:
