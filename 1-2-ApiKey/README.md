# 1. What is an API key and why do I need one?
#### What is an API Key?
```Application programming interface key```. API keys are used to track and control how the API is being used, in order to prevent malicious user or abuse of the API. The API key is a unique identifier for each user and a secret token for authentication.

**So please do not share your APIs!** :exclamation:

To being able to use ```google APIs``` you need to have a ```google account```. If you don't have one you can create it [here](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

Once you are login into your ```Google account``` go to [Google maps API pages](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).
