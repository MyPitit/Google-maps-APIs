# Heat map

We are going to create a map with all the data between the years 1900 and 2012 with the temperature variations in the United Kingdom. For this exercise you will need to use your ```API key```.

You will learn:
* How to import data into your Maps application.
* Display that data on a map using simple markers.
* Use symbols and heatmaps to improve the appearence and legibility of your map, and to reperesent secondary information.

For this tutorial I will be using the same code from the tutorial [Adding Google maps](https://github.com/MyPitit/Google-maps-APIs/tree/master/AddingGMapTutorial) as a kick start.

Before we go any further, we need to get some data from another source, I decided to use the [World Bank Data](http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/) for this tutorial.

I already download the data we are going to use for this project, click here to download the file. But please feel free to browse the [World Bank Data](http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/) to see what other resources you can use for other projects.
