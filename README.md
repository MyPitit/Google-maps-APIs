# Who
I am Mireia Sangalo, full stack JavaScript developer at Founders and Coders. I used to be a Linux SysAdmin at [Rackspace the Open Cloud Company](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/), but I decided to change my career as full stack JavaScript developer.

Thanks to the team from [Founders and Coders](www.foundersandcoders.com) I could reach my goals and became a competent engineer.
